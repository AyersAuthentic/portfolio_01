# Kevin's Developer Portfolio (mvp version 01)

## Overview

This is the first iteration of my personal developer portfolio website, built using Flask. It's a simple, minimalistic version, focusing on establishing the basic structure and functionality.

## Key Features (Version 1.0)

- **Basic Flask Setup:** A simple Flask application serving as the backbone of the website.
- **Home Page:** A rudimentary home page with a brief introduction about myself.
- **Contact Information:** Basic contact details.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A micro web framework written in Python, used for the backend.
- HTML/CSS: For the frontend structure and design.

## How to Run Locally

1. Ensure you have Python and Flask installed on your machine.

   - Python: Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Flask: Run `pip install Flask` in your command line.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd [project directory name]
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   (depending on your setup)

5. Access the website at `localhost:5000` or the specified port in your web browser.

## Current Limitations

- This version has limited features and serves as a foundational setup for future developments.
- The design and content are minimal and will be enhanced in subsequent versions.

## Future Enhancements

- Addition of a Projects section to showcase my work.
- Inclusion of an 'About Me' page with detailed professional background.
- Implementation of a more advanced and responsive UI/UX design.
- Integration of additional Flask features and possibly a database for dynamic content.
